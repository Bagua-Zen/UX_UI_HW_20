           <h4>As I looked for problems the average user might have with navigation and ease of access (all the while refining my understanding of the users needs based on interviews and other forms of evaluation and research)  I found more problems than I wanted to or could fix in the time given.</h4>

          <h1>The problem statement uncovered</h1>
          <div id=probSol>
           <li>The Problem:
            Overwhelming amounts of information and a shoddy navigation process make it difficult for users to easily navigate the Department of Education website which houses the info of many other departments.
           </li>
           <li> My Solution:
            Creating a minimalist design with curated content that helps keep the interface clean by displaying only pivotal information and housing more robust information for common users.

          <div class="rowOfInfoCon">
            <p>So I set about reorganizing the site based on the results of thourough card sorting to look for useful patterns and insight.</p>

          <h1>How the work was iterated based on user testing</h1>
          <div>
           <p>Ease of access to information of relevance to different main user groups, and clarity of navigation became key. 
            Four types of users who come to the ED.gov website.
            <li>Students or families looking for information on student loans.</li>
            <li> Businesses, non-profits and individuals looking for information about grants.</li>
            <li> School administrators or relevant stakeholders looking for information on laws impacting their school.</li>
            <li> Users of all kinds interested in data relevant to education in the United States.</li></p>

           </div>
           <p>The design went through various iterations in an attempt to make the site a bit easier to digest by planning for more infographics, segmenting out information  with clear headings, and making use of “White space” in addition to other design approaches.</p>

            <p>The first two images below are the main page site before and After with the biggest difference being the change in clutter and initial overload allowing one more time to first process navigation.</p>

            <ul>
              <p>The end result wound up being a need for curated content via an updated navigation bar for better clarity:   </p>
              <li>An updated landing page with simplified navigation in two forms.</li>
              <li>Three new curated "homepages" for users to best provide both common and new/one-time users with the fastest access to all the information they would need.</li>

            <p>The main pages listed in the navigation and starting with the landing page were all sorted, curated, and simplified for an easier viewing experience with less clutter on the page and a little color to feel more welcoming.</p>

           <p>Final thoughts and notes for future iterations: Though there were more problems than I could fix I did what I could to work on base key information structuring and organization while minimizing overload, though it became a bit text-heavy as I did not have time to develop proper infographics. </p>
