           <p>“ED's mission is to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access.</p>
           <ul>
            <li>Establishing policies on federal financial aid for education, and distributing as well as monitoring those funds.</li>
            <li>Collecting data on America's schools and disseminating research.</li>
            <li>Focusing national attention on key educational issues.</li>
            <li>Prohibiting discrimination and ensuring equal access to education.”</li>

           <h4>As I looked for problems the average user might have with navigation and ease of access (all the while refining my understanding of the users needs based on interviews and other forms of evaluation and research)  I found more problems than I wanted to or could fix in the time given. I, like many of the users, felt at a loss fo where to start.</h4>

          <h1>The problem statement uncovered</h1>

           <li>The Problem:
            Overwhelming amounts of information and a shoddy navigation process make it difficult for users to easily navigate the Department of Education website.
           </li>
           <li> My Solution:
            Creating a minimalist design with curated content that helps keep the interface clean by displaying only pivotal information and housing more robust information for common users.
           </li>
          </div>
          <img src="./images/image 218.png" alt="">
          <p>So I set about reorganizing the site based on the results of thourough card sorting to look for useful patterns and insight.</p>

          <h1>How the work was iterated based on user testing</h1>
          <div>
           <p>Ease of access to information of relevance to different main user groups, and clarity of navigation became key. 
            Four types of users who come to the ED.gov website.
            Students or families looking for information on student loans.
            Businesses, non-profits and individuals looking for information about grants.
            School administrators or relevant stakeholders looking for information on laws impacting their school.
            Users of all kinds interested in data relevant to education in the United States.
            
            The design went through various iterations in an attempt to make the site a bit easier to digest by planning for more infographics, segmenting out information  with clear headings, and making use of “White space” in addition to other design approaches.</p>

        <div class="results" id="section5">
          <h1>The final prototype that solved the problem</h1>
          <p>The end result wound up being a need for curated content via an updated navigation bar for better clarity, a main homepage and 3 sub curated homepages so as to best provide new and exhausting users with the fastest access to all the information they would need as it pertains to the main users. </p>

          <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-04-29 230644 1.png" alt="">
          <ul>Final thoughts and notes for future iterations: 
            <li>A better home landing page</li>
            <li>Curated content pages for Students and parents, Teachers, and administrators for easier fact finding and navigation.</li>
            <li>A new visual overlay</li>
            <li>A little less text heavy in favor of better of more white space and better visuals.</li>
            <li>Simpler navigation to pages with better organized content.</li>
